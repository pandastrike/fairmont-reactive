From the `examples/web-apps/todo-list` directory, do the following:

- Install the dependencies for the example.

```
npm install
```

- Run the build task.

```
node_modules/.bin/p9k build
```

- Run the Web server.

```
node_modules/.bin/p9k serve
```

```
To view web app, go to: http://localhost:1337/
```

If you want to experiment with the example code, you can also watch the source files for changes.

```
p9k watch
```

(You will still need to reload the browser, but the app should automatically rebuild on each change.)
